# d20.DiceRoller

This was a fun little project that I made to demo Blazor to a friend. It showcases a d20 dice roll animation, brought to life entirely through the art of CSS (technically SASS, compiled into CSS).  What makes this project really cool is how it seamlessly integrates with the Blazor Server side code to generate the actual dice values.
